116," Giving feedback to students is the activity that takes most staff time in the courses I teach. Anything that makes it more effective, or frees up time for other activities, can therefore have a great impact on the quality of the students' learning. Immediate feedback may help performance in the moment, but more time to consider problems by themselves might be better for learning. "," Automated processes can generate some types of feedback, for example using unit tests and style checkers. This can save staff time and enable students to get feedback quickly (but see question 1) and at any time. However, it requires significant up-front effort to implement, which must be directed where it does the most good. I would like to reduce the staff time in our courses spent correcting and explaining code errors that could be detected automatically. However, I want to avoid replacing this with automated feedback that doesn't provide the same benefits, and am also concerned that giving instant feedback may sometimes encourage students to program by trial and error instead of understanding the problems and solutions. "," As per Q2, automatic (unit) tests can provide a type of rapid feedback that could be useful to novice programmers as well as to more experienced ones. I would like to know how best to introduce and use them. Do students use the instant results to programme by trial and error, and is this any different to an expert using test-driven design? The aim in teaching is different in that the goal is understanding and transfer to future tasks, rather than simply working code right now. Is this potential problem avoided if students write their own tests, which in itself requires more understanding? "," Assessment using an extended programming task or project is appealing in that it provides an ""authentic"" test of ability, and students find it enjoyable. However, it brings a high staff marking workload, and it is particularly hard to ensure fair and consistent marking: if students all have different projects then their work is hard to compare (and even more effort is needed to set the tasks) but if many students are carrying out the same task then it is hard to know how much of the work is the student's own. Currently we use ""mini-projects"" only in fairly small courses.

117,"I have been teaching workshops with the assumption that using participant code and data would improve participant learning, but it creates a heterogeneous room (so more chaos) so maybe it is not actually better for learning.
